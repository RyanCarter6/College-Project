# C++ College Project

The main problem of this project seemed to be opening and closing files while inputting/outputting data. Other than getting/putting the data somewhere, I think this project was also used to show proficiency in accessing that data and applying new concepts.

I feel like my code is very clean; I have getters and setters for my map, I used switch statements, and I made functions to open the files which kept main() shorter and more readable.

The most challenging part was definitely iterating through the map. To overcome this, I looked through Stack Overflow and derived my solution from what I found.

I feel like I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using proper spacing, following the same naming conventions throughout the project, and frequently adding comments that explain the code. This will hopefully make the project easier to comprehend, making any future updates easy to apply.
